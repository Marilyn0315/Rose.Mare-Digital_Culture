# DH Project- Fan Studies in Fanfiction and Heterotopia

Fanfiction, at its core, is content written by fans of a text to which they generally have a lot of passion for. The original source of what the fanfiction is based on varies immensely, for example fanfiction can be inspired by: books, movies, television shows, video games, celebrities, and essentially anything that a person most often enjoys and/or is passionate about. Fanfiction can also be written as a joke or contrarily, which is why I hesitate to prescribe it as purely out of enjoyment or passion. For many, fanfiction is an extension of the original text source that serves as a way to enjoy more content that would otherwise not exist. Similarly, fanfiction is a creative outlet for people to sometimes explore a fictional storyworld in an alternative way to how it is explored in the original source material. 

In this project, I will explore why people use fanfiction as a source of queer representation, comfort, and self-identification, particularly in a sociopolitical climate where queer representation is often met with hostility. I will be demonstrating how using fanfiction as a way to self-identify within a text and construct representation is heterotopic in nature. Throughout the essay, I will be analyzing fandom discourse from my own experience in the Dragon Age fandom concerning popular characters and a fictional religion such as Dorian Pavus, Alistair Theirin, and the Qun.

#### What is Fanfiction?
***“Appropriative writing takes many shapes, and fan fiction, the term originating in the1960s to describe stories published in homemade fanzines, is but the latest manifestation of the  desire to concretely interact with a pre-existing narrative. Fanfic thus has affinities with a wide range of practices, finding their outlet in allographs prequels and sequels, but also in works that retell events from an alternative character's point of view, or that "borrow" a character and transpose her or him into a new setting and a new narrative arc” -Leavenworth 42*** 


### Sociopolitical Issues and Fandom Discourse
Having canonical representations of LGBTQ characters and relationships is important to the people within this community, and a lack of representation has shown to be harmful to those marginalized (Llewellyn 2350). Despite fanfiction having freedom for queer authors to write their own stories, these kinds of queer fanfictions are created out of an absence of canonical representation (Llewellyn 2350). Although canonical queer representation has increased over the years, there is also an increase in negative representation such as stereotyping and repetitive and harmful tropes concerning LGBTQ people (Llewellyn 2350). As such fanfictions stand as a pertinent part of fandom, as the reimagined narrative adapted from canonical texts often reflect real queer experiences and perspective– an important cultural artifact (Llewellyn 2350). It is also integral to note that “that fanfictions are central to lesbian fandom identities exploration and normalization that can be missing from the physical world or media texts. Broader LGBTQ research suggests that the retelling and reimagining of stories can be a place for LGBTQ identity exploration and may also be a place for political activism” (Llewellyn 2350). 

*"Problematic" content:*
I use quotes on the word problematic, because what makes something problematic is entirely subjective, and at times myopic (as I will explore later). That is not to say that fanfiction or fanart cannot be problematic (if it affirms racism or sexual depictions of minors for example, this is a problem), but that the term is easily misused by individuals who disagree with perhaps the depiction of a character or inspiration for a fictional religion because it does not suit their own interpretation.

One example of fan discourse concerning problematic fan-content that I have encountered is the heterosexualization of a canonically homosexual character named Dorian Pavus in Dragon Age: Inquisition. For brief context, Dragon Age is an RPG game series set in a magical medieval fantasy setting. There is one playable character and they are accompanied by companions as they complete their journey. The playable character can become friends, enemies, and/or lovers with their companions, which sometimes impacts the story heavily. There is an approval system, so a companion's reaction to a choice the player makes can vary greatly depending on whether they have low or high approval. This particular change of sexuality with Dorian is more complicated for fans to come to a consensus with, because the character Dorian has a storyline that, with enough character approval, explores how Dorian’s father did not approve of his sexuality and essentially attempted conversion therapy against Dorian’s wishes.

      * *OK, those are pretty fine brownies. The first batch were slightly undercooked and too crumbly to hold together. The second let I cooked at gas mark 5 for about 40 minutes and then put            straight into the fridge. No faffing about with ice baths. Pecans go pretty well as well as walnuts.*

    * *Nigel's brownie recipe has been engraved on my brain from the first day I made it, it was so good. I edit it very slightly to my own taste, using 85-100% cacao chocolate, because I like         it to be bitter, and adding cinnamon, nutmeg, a splash of vanilla and a healthy dose of cayenne to them to give them a mexican spice. There is nothing I'd rather eat at 3pm when I'm half         asleep over my desk and need to be woken up. Brilliant.*

    * *I have come across the most divine brownie recipe with a twist - it has cheesecake mix through it. The cheesecake cuts through the richness of the chocolate. It's my new favourite dish.         Either on it's own or warm with a berry coulis... mmmm....*

      * *I think brownies need to have three distinct layers: crunchy top (achieved by using a lot of caster sugar), gooey middle, and fudgey bottom. If you put white chocolate chunks in they sink to the bottom and caramelise a little, I love that. This is the best recipe I know: http://yogicknitter.blogspot.com/2008_03_01_archive.html*

      * *The following brownie recipe is based on a French staple ingredient: sweetened chestnut puree. Please trust me on this one and try it. It does not contain much sugar or fat and it's     
      extremely easy to make, gluten free and Utterly Delicious.*
      
      *250 grams of very dark chocolate (70 % plus)
      500 gram tin of sweetened chestnut puree
      6 egg whites
      6 egg yolks
      125 grams very soft butter
      3 tablespoons sugar*
      
      *1. preheat oven to 180 degrees Celsius
      2. melt chocolate au bain Marie in a big glass bowl
      3. allow chocolate to cool a little
      4. add the butter and stir
      5. add the chestnut puree and stir some more
      6. add the egg yolks to this and stir until you’ve got an even mixture
      7. beat the egg whites, in another bowl, until firm
      8. sprinkle the sugar on whites and beat until you've got very firm and glossy peaks
      9. gently fold the whites into the chocolate mixture
      10. pour the mixture into a brownie tin and bake until it looks done but the centre still feels soft to the touch
      11. allow to cool, cut and eat.*

    * *The earlier post from Imkm was right on the mark. Brownies should be chewy, not under-cooked. In the UK American brownie recipes are invariably undercooked. When the top looks done, the         bottom is still raw. This occurs because UK ovens heat with 'surround' heat and American ovens have the majority of the heat coming from the bottom of the oven. This is why Alice Medrich         (in the US) puts her brownie pan in an ice bath. This step should be unnecessary in the UK.
      An additional reason for the undercooked, wet texture of brownies in the UK is that American flour absorbs more liquid than UK flour.
      I look forward to trying Felicity's recipe. There is always room for more brownies.*

*did this recipe for my son's bday and it came out really good*

*My grandma must've found this recipe a couple years ago, because that's when she gave it to my family. We love it! However, this recipe doesn't have absolutely PREFECT chocolate frosting that came with the one my grandma gave us, so I thought I'd help out a bit: ½ C Butter/ 2/3 C Cocoa/ 1 Tsp. Vanilla/ 3 C Powdered Sugar/ 1/3 C Milk - Melt butter, stir in cocoa. Alternately add sugar and milk, beating to spreading consistency. If necessary, thin with additional milk. Add vanilla. - There we go! I use this frosting recipe every time, and it's perfect for this cake. Hope I helped!!!*

*This cake will be printed out as my new basic chocolate cake. Everything about it was nice, I did add a teaspoon of instant coffee to the boiling water and the batter was thin. Baked up perfect - I did line the tin and use oil spray. Tastes better than some expensive box mixes. Wasn't overly moist either, just not dry at all. Thanks. UPDATE: Up the amount of cocoa to 1 cup and make sure it's the best quality. I use a European brand. You can use melted butter if you run out of oil. You can use whipped cream, cocoa powder and icing sugar for a great icing.*

*I have joyfully been trying many different cake/frosting recipes from this site and I must say this is about the most moist and delicious I have found! I used this to make cupcakes and what a perfect batter for the task! It's so "runny" you just pour it into the liners. Halve the recipe and you get 12 cupcakes. Fill the liners 3/4 way full. They come out fluffy and very moist- PERFECT! I used the "Rich Chocolate Frosting" from this site and it too was superb. (I wrote a review on it as well.)*

*This is the exact recipe that is on the back of the Hershey Cocoa can. I have been using this same recipe for years! So much better than a box mix!*

*Absolutely delicious and so EASY to make! We made this for a birthday party just last weekend and made another one last night for ourselves. Perfect with some whipped topping, we added a 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips to make it even more chocolatey! If you do this, make sure to sprinkle it on top of the batter AFTER you have poured it into the baking pan, let them just sit on the top. Since the batter is thin, mixing them in will cause them to sink to the bottom and stick to the pan as you try to get the cake out.*

*I googled to find a chocolate cake recipe for a baking contest, and picked this one for it's simplicity due to my busy schedule. I won! I won with a perfect score!! The greatest thing about this cake is how moist it is.... not just fresh-baked, but even a couple of days later. I am adding this recipe to my recipe box! HINT: I use the shorter baking time with all recipes, subtract 5 minutes, and check the cake by touching with a finger to see if it springs back. What you want is for the cake to spring back but still sound "wet" inside.... Turn off your oven, close the door and let the cake finish its last 5 minutes of bake time. This will allow the cake to set without drying out. Try it!*

*This recipe is awesome but remember it will only come out as great as the ingredients you use. I used Hershey's cocoa powder because that's what I had on hand but I would recommend using the highest quality cocoa you can afford! The batter IS really thin, I am SO glad that the recipe included that warning because I woulld have thought I did something wrong. Don't worry!*

*I found this recipe a little under a year ago, and I can't count how many times I've made it. I will never, I repeat, NEVER make another chocolate cake again! I get asked for the recipe constantly, and friends and family beg me to make it. Tip: I make mine with 100% whole wheat flour and you can't tell the difference AT ALL! If you're looking for the best, most moist and flavorful chocolate cake you've ever had, YOU FOUND IT!*
