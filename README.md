# DH Project- Fan Studies in Fanfiction and Heterotopia

Fanfiction, at its core, is content written by fans of a text to which they generally have a lot of passion for. The original source of what the fanfiction is based on varies immensely, for example fanfiction can be inspired by: books, movies, television shows, video games, celebrities, and essentially anything that a person most often enjoys and/or is passionate about. Fanfiction can also be written as a joke or contrarily, which is why I hesitate to prescribe it as purely out of enjoyment or passion. For many, fanfiction is an extension of the original text source that serves as a way to enjoy more content that would otherwise not exist. Similarly, fanfiction is a creative outlet for people to sometimes explore a fictional storyworld in an alternative way to how it is explored in the original source material. 

In this project, I will explore why people use fanfiction as a source of queer representation, comfort, and self-identification, particularly in a sociopolitical climate where queer representation is often met with hostility. I will be demonstrating how using fanfiction as a way to self-identify within a text and construct representation is heterotopic in nature. Throughout the essay, I will be analyzing fandom discourse from my own experience in the Dragon Age fandom concerning popular characters and a fictional religion such as Dorian Pavus, Alistair Theirin, and the Qun.

#### What is Fanfiction?
***“Appropriative writing takes many shapes, and fan fiction, the term originating in the1960s to describe stories published in homemade fanzines, is but the latest manifestation of the  desire to concretely interact with a pre-existing narrative. Fanfic thus has affinities with a wide range of practices, finding their outlet in allographs prequels and sequels, but also in works that retell events from an alternative character's point of view, or that "borrow" a character and transpose her or him into a new setting and a new narrative arc” -Leavenworth 42*** 


### Sociopolitical Issues and Fandom Discourse
Having canonical representations of LGBTQ characters and relationships is important to the people within this community, and a lack of representation has shown to be harmful to those marginalized (Llewellyn 2350). Despite fanfiction having freedom for queer authors to write their own stories, these kinds of queer fanfictions are created out of an absence of canonical representation (Llewellyn 2350). Although canonical queer representation has increased over the years, there is also an increase in negative representation such as stereotyping and repetitive and harmful tropes concerning LGBTQ people (Llewellyn 2350). As such fanfictions stand as a pertinent part of fandom, as the reimagined narrative adapted from canonical texts often reflect real queer experiences and perspective– an important cultural artifact (Llewellyn 2350). It is also integral to note that “that fanfictions are central to lesbian fandom identities exploration and normalization that can be missing from the physical world or media texts. Broader LGBTQ research suggests that the retelling and reimagining of stories can be a place for LGBTQ identity exploration and may also be a place for political activism” (Llewellyn 2350). 

*"Problematic" content:*
I use quotes on the word problematic, because what makes something problematic is entirely subjective, and at times myopic (as I will explore later). That is not to say that fanfiction or fanart cannot be problematic (if it affirms racism or sexual depictions of minors for example, this is a problem), but that the term is easily misused by individuals who disagree with perhaps the depiction of a character or inspiration for a fictional religion because it does not suit their own interpretation.

One example of fan discourse concerning problematic fan-content that I have encountered is the heterosexualization of a canonically homosexual character named Dorian Pavus in Dragon Age: Inquisition. For brief context, Dragon Age is an RPG game series set in a magical medieval fantasy setting. There is one playable character and they are accompanied by companions as they complete their journey. The playable character can become friends, enemies, and/or lovers with their companions, which sometimes impacts the story heavily. There is an approval system, so a companion's reaction to a choice the player makes can vary greatly depending on whether they have low or high approval. This particular change of sexuality with Dorian is more complicated for fans to come to a consensus with, because the character Dorian has a storyline that, with enough character approval, explores how Dorian’s father did not approve of his sexuality and essentially attempted conversion therapy against Dorian’s wishes. The following posts hold similar beliefs:

      * *OK, those are pretty fine brownies. The first batch were slightly undercooked and too crumbly to hold together. The second let I cooked at gas mark 5 for about 40 minutes and then put            straight into the fridge. No faffing about with ice baths. Pecans go pretty well as well as walnuts.*
  * postJazz, 12 Sep 2010
    * *Nigel's brownie recipe has been engraved on my brain from the first day I made it, it was so good. I edit it very slightly to my own taste, using 85-100% cacao chocolate, because I like         it to be bitter, and adding cinnamon, nutmeg, a splash of vanilla and a healthy dose of cayenne to them to give them a mexican spice. There is nothing I'd rather eat at 3pm when I'm half         asleep over my desk and need to be woken up. Brilliant.*
  * emzlt, 11 Sep 2010 
    * *I have come across the most divine brownie recipe with a twist - it has cheesecake mix through it. The cheesecake cuts through the richness of the chocolate. It's my new favourite dish.         Either on it's own or warm with a berry coulis... mmmm....*

      * *I worship at the alter of St Nigel. ShallowDays, you haven't lived until you've tried his recipe...*
  * sarahdotcom, 10 Sep 2010
      * *I think brownies need to have three distinct layers: crunchy top (achieved by using a lot of caster sugar), gooey middle, and fudgey bottom. If you put white chocolate chunks in they sink to the bottom and caramelise a little, I love that. This is the best recipe I know: http://yogicknitter.blogspot.com/2008_03_01_archive.html*
  * Machiavella, 10 Sep 2010
      * *The following brownie recipe is based on a French staple ingredient: sweetened chestnut puree. Please trust me on this one and try it. It does not contain much sugar or fat and it's     
      extremely easy to make, gluten free and Utterly Delicious.*
      
      *250 grams of very dark chocolate (70 % plus)
      500 gram tin of sweetened chestnut puree
      6 egg whites
      6 egg yolks
      125 grams very soft butter
      3 tablespoons sugar*
      
      *1. preheat oven to 180 degrees Celsius
      2. melt chocolate au bain Marie in a big glass bowl
      3. allow chocolate to cool a little
      4. add the butter and stir
      5. add the chestnut puree and stir some more
      6. add the egg yolks to this and stir until you’ve got an even mixture
      7. beat the egg whites, in another bowl, until firm
      8. sprinkle the sugar on whites and beat until you've got very firm and glossy peaks
      9. gently fold the whites into the chocolate mixture
      10. pour the mixture into a brownie tin and bake until it looks done but the centre still feels soft to the touch
      11. allow to cool, cut and eat.*
  * stirgently, 10 Sep 2010
    * *The earlier post from Imkm was right on the mark. Brownies should be chewy, not under-cooked. In the UK American brownie recipes are invariably undercooked. When the top looks done, the         bottom is still raw. This occurs because UK ovens heat with 'surround' heat and American ovens have the majority of the heat coming from the bottom of the oven. This is why Alice Medrich         (in the US) puts her brownie pan in an ice bath. This step should be unnecessary in the UK.
      An additional reason for the undercooked, wet texture of brownies in the UK is that American flour absorbs more liquid than UK flour.
      I look forward to trying Felicity's recipe. There is always room for more brownies.*

  * *My grandma must've found this recipe a couple years ago, because that's when she gave it to my family. We love it! However, this recipe doesn't have absolutely PREFECT chocolate frosting        that came with the one my grandma gave us, so I thought I'd help out a bit: ½ C Butter/ 2/3 C Cocoa/ 1 Tsp. Vanilla/ 3 C Powdered Sugar/ 1/3 C Milk - Melt butter, stir in cocoa.           Alternately add sugar and milk, beating to spreading consistency. If necessary, thin with additional milk. Add vanilla. - There we go! I use this frosting recipe every time, and it's perfect for this cake. Hope I helped!!!*

  * *This cake will be printed out as my new basic chocolate cake. Everything about it was nice, I did add a teaspoon of instant coffee to the boiling water and the batter was thin. Baked up    
    perfect - I did line the tin and use oil spray. Tastes better than some expensive box mixes. Wasn't overly moist either, just not dry at all. Thanks. UPDATE: Up the amount of cocoa to 1 cup 
    and make sure it's the best quality. I use a European brand. You can use melted butter if you run out of oil. You can use whipped cream, cocoa powder and icing sugar for a great icing.*

 * *I have joyfully been trying many different cake/frosting recipes from this site and I must say this is about the most moist and delicious I have found! I used this to make cupcakes and what     a perfect batter for the task! It's so "runny" you just pour it into the liners. Halve the recipe and you get 12 cupcakes. Fill the liners 3/4 way full. They come out fluffy and very moist-     PERFECT! I used the "Rich Chocolate Frosting" from this site and it too was superb. (I wrote a review on it as well.)*

  * 06/06/2007
  * *Absolutely delicious and so EASY to make! We made this for a birthday party just last weekend and made another one last night for ourselves. Perfect with some whipped topping, we added a        1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips to make it even more chocolatey! If you do this, make sure to sprinkle it on top of the batter AFTER you have poured it into the baking pan, let them just        sit on the top. Since the batter is thin, mixing them in will cause them to sink to the bottom and stick to the pan as you try to get the cake out.*

* Benda G
  * 05/23/2011
  * *I googled to find a chocolate cake recipe for a baking contest, and picked this one for it's simplicity due to my busy schedule. I won! I won with a perfect score!! The greatest thing           about this cake is how moist it is.... not just fresh-baked, but even a couple of days later. I am adding this recipe to my recipe box! HINT: I use the shorter baking time with all       recipes, subtract 5 minutes, and check the cake by touching with a finger to see if it springs back. What you want is for the cake to spring back but still sound "wet" inside.... Turn off your oven, close the door and let the cake finish its last 5 minutes of bake time. This will allow the cake to set without drying out. Try it!*

  * *This recipe is awesome but remember it will only come out as great as the ingredients you use. I used Hershey's cocoa powder because that's what I had on hand but I would recommend using the highest quality cocoa you can afford! The batter IS really thin, I am SO glad that the recipe included that warning because I woulld have thought I did something wrong. Don't worry!* 

* robismil
  * 04/13/2008
  * *I found this recipe a little under a year ago, and I can't count how many times I've made it. I will never, I repeat, NEVER make another chocolate cake again! I get asked for the recipe constantly, and friends and family beg me to make it. Tip: I make mine with 100% whole wheat flour and you can't tell the difference AT ALL! If you're looking for the best, most moist and flavorful chocolate cake you've ever had, YOU FOUND IT!*

### Marijuana Brownie recipe - https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/how-to-make-weed-brownies?srsltid=AfmBOoqGxP6ckokORqW_DqOXYihFEYU3HjDrb46gbgV67Ep5U-AMWHd- 
Interesting discourse on marijuana consumption in the comments of this edible brownie recipe. Somehow, a user finds it appropriate to attack the Left. 

Ingredients
½g cannabis flower
1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter
⅔ cup coarsely chopped pecans or walnuts
Nonstick vegetable oil spray or room-temperature unsalted butter (for pan)
1 cup (84 g) Dutch-process cocoa powder
1¼ cups (250 g) light brown sugar
2 tsp. vanilla bean paste or vanilla extract
1 tsp. instant espresso powder (optional)
1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt
2 large eggs
⅔ cup (84 g) all-purpose flour
Flaky sea salt (optional)

Special Equipment
An oven thermometer
Preparation
Step 1
Place a rack and an oven thermometer in middle of oven; preheat to 225°. Using your fingers, gently break up ½ g cannabis flower into raisin-size pieces and spread out in an even layer on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake, gently tossing every 10 minutes or so to avoid burning, until weed turns brownish green (indicating it has decarboxylated), 10–20 minutes if using old or lower-quality weed, 15–30 minutes for cured high-quality weed, or 45–60 minutes for anything recently harvested and still damp. Let cool on baking sheet. Increase oven temperature to 350°.

Step 2
Pour water into a medium saucepan to come about 2" up sides. Place a medium heatproof mixing bowl over pot (bowl should not touch water) and set over medium-low heat. Heat ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter and 1 Tbsp. water until butter is melted. Crumble weed with your hands directly into butter. Discard parchment paper; reserve baking sheet. Reduce heat to low and cook, checking occasionally with an instant-read thermometer and adjusting heat as needed to ensure butter temperature does not exceed 190°, 1 hour.

Step 3
Meanwhile, spread out ⅔ cup coarsely chopped pecans or walnuts on reserved baking sheet and toast, tossing halfway through, until slightly darkened in color and fragrant, 8–10 minutes.

Step 4
Lightly coat an 8x8" baking pan with nonstick vegetable oil spray or room-temperature unsalted butter, then line with parchment paper, leaving generous overhang on 2 sides. Lightly coat parchment with nonstick spray or butter.

Step 5
Pour cannabis-infused butter through a fine-mesh sieve into a large heatproof bowl. Immediately stir in 1 cup (84 g) Dutch-process cocoa powder followed by 1¼ cups (250 g) light brown sugar, 2 tsp. vanilla bean paste or vanilla extract, 1 tsp. instant espresso powder (if using), and 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt with a rubber spatula. Add 2 large eggs, one at a time, whisking until incorporated after each addition. Continue to whisk vigorously until mixture is glossy, lightened in color, and slightly increased in volume. Stir in ⅔ cup (84 g) all-purpose flour, then pecans. Scrape batter into prepared baking pan; smooth surface. Sprinkle flaky sea salt over if desired.

Step 6
Bake brownies until set on top and a tester inserted into the center comes out with just a few moist crumbs attached, 25–28 minutes. Remove from oven and tap on stovetop a couple times to deflate slightly (this boosts their chewy-fudgy texture). Let cool 15 minutes, then chill until completely cool, about 45 minutes.

Step 7
Using parchment paper overhang, remove brownies from pan and cut into 16 pieces (about 6¼ mg THC per piece), 12 pieces (about 8⅓ mg THC per piece), or 9 pieces (about 11 mg THC per piece).

Both my sons are allergic to pistachios, cashews, and macadamia nuts. Ingestion causes anaphylactic shock up to and possibly including respiratory failure. A handful of pistachios, in other words, could kill them. Below this recipe is a link to another recipe for a pale-green treat called Pistacharoos, which looks to be chock-full of what is to my sons, poison.

I'm not sure though, because I didn't click on it. Why? Because I know it's not for me or my family. Did I freak out? Did I tell the story about the mislabeled granola bar and the hugely swollen tongue and the ER visit and how NEVER AGAIN will I . . . no I did not. I did not just land on the internet yesterday.

Hi, I have kind of what seems like a dumb question, but I am no baker because of it's required precision. Can I make this recipe and leave out the weed? I am looking for a fudgy brownie recipe to make for my family and the image looks exactly what I am looking for. I assume I just leave out step one and just heat up the butter to temp in step 2?

.5 grams seems incredibly low for an entire batch of brownies? I’ve never seen a recipe use less than 3.5g. .5 grams is equal to 1SMALL joint, which if shared by 12 people would probably equate to 1/2 puff per person - I just don’t understand such a small amount being considered a dose. I’d make myself sick eating brownies trying to get a buzz off of this.

2nd marijuana recipe in two months (different issues)…I’m not interested and am bothered by this. I don’t want to have these recipes intermingled in the issues I save. Why don’t you just make one thin “cookbook” of weed recipes as an insert in a single issue or as a stand-alone keepsake for indulgers? That way, when it is published, those that aren’t interested or opposed, can simply recycle it and be done?  I have been a subscriber for many years, an avid cook and fan of Bob Appetit recipes, but recently the  magazine has a very different vibe that I am losing interest in. Too bad.

I like how this recipe has instructions for dosing. If this your first foray into edibles, go VERY slow - slower than you think you should. Only use a small dose until you are experienced; I would personally go 5mg or less (meaning for the entire time that day you using; not each bite, etc). If you are a little more experienced, and you are not feeling anything after your first dose, wait at LEAST 1 hour (1.5 or 2 is better) before having another dose because sometimes it takes a while to kick-in. Be careful: having too much edibles can be a HORRIBLE experience.

Like all substances, weed is for responsible adults.

The dosage is remarkably low.  1/2 gram for a 8x8 pan of brownies?? That should probably be at least 7 grams. Control the dosage be the size of the brownie otherwise 3 people would have to eat nearly the whole pan of brownies before they would have the munchies for the brownies.

Clearly BA is trying to do something clever for 4/20, but as the other readers point out, the higher strengths of THC have increased the incidences of addiction and psychosis to alarming rates - just ask any psychiatrist or addiction specialist. It happened to our son and two years later, we are just starting to get our feet back under us after one of the most terrifying and tragic seasons of our family’s life. 

I’m grappling with the difference between printing a cannabis recipe and a cocktail recipe and I can’t quite work it out, aside from the fact that too few people seem aware that we are no longer dealing with the same drug we all grew up with. I do appreciate the author’s focus on correct dosing etc.

This makes me so angry!!! Please educate to learn about  today’s high potency THC.  It causes psychosis in 30% of users because of the high THC levels now. Our son, along with a1000 others that we have connected with, experienced CIP- his 3 times each time taking a year or more off of his life with rehab, outpatient rehab, numerous med changes when he never needed any meds before he used weed.  This is not good for society and BA should be thinking what this is doing to our youth and young adults before publishing a recipe that encourages them to use marijuana. 😡😡😡
