# Context of me - Previous DH Project/interests - Fan Studies in Fanfiction and Heterotopia

Fanfiction, at its core, is content written by fans of a text to which they generally have a lot of passion for. The original source of what the fanfiction is based on varies immensely, for example fanfiction can be inspired by: books, movies, television shows, video games, celebrities, and essentially anything that a person most often enjoys and/or is passionate about. Fanfiction can also be written as a joke or contrarily, which is why I hesitate to prescribe it as purely out of enjoyment or passion. For many, fanfiction is an extension of the original text source that serves as a way to enjoy more content that would otherwise not exist. Similarly, fanfiction is a creative outlet for people to sometimes explore a fictional storyworld in an alternative way to how it is explored in the original source material. 

In this project, I will explore why people use fanfiction as a source of queer representation, comfort, and self-identification, particularly in a sociopolitical climate where queer representation is often met with hostility. I will be demonstrating how using fanfiction as a way to self-identify within a text and construct representation is heterotopic in nature. Throughout the essay, I will be analyzing fandom discourse from my own experience in the Dragon Age fandom concerning popular characters and a fictional religion such as Dorian Pavus, Alistair Theirin, and the Qun.

#### What is Fanfiction?
***“Appropriative writing takes many shapes, and fan fiction, the term originating in the1960s to describe stories published in homemade fanzines, is but the latest manifestation of the  desire to concretely interact with a pre-existing narrative. Fanfic thus has affinities with a wide range of practices, finding their outlet in allographs prequels and sequels, but also in works that retell events from an alternative character's point of view, or that "borrow" a character and transpose her or him into a new setting and a new narrative arc” -Leavenworth 42*** 


### Sociopolitical Issues and Fandom Discourse
Having canonical representations of LGBTQ characters and relationships is important to the people within this community, and a lack of representation has shown to be harmful to those marginalized (Llewellyn 2350). Despite fanfiction having freedom for queer authors to write their own stories, these kinds of queer fanfictions are created out of an absence of canonical representation (Llewellyn 2350). Although canonical queer representation has increased over the years, there is also an increase in negative representation such as stereotyping and repetitive and harmful tropes concerning LGBTQ people (Llewellyn 2350). As such fanfictions stand as a pertinent part of fandom, as the reimagined narrative adapted from canonical texts often reflect real queer experiences and perspective– an important cultural artifact (Llewellyn 2350). It is also integral to note that “that fanfictions are central to lesbian fandom identities exploration and normalization that can be missing from the physical world or media texts. Broader LGBTQ research suggests that the retelling and reimagining of stories can be a place for LGBTQ identity exploration and may also be a place for political activism” (Llewellyn 2350). 

*"Problematic" content:*
I use quotes on the word problematic, because what makes something problematic is entirely subjective, and at times myopic (as I will explore later). That is not to say that fanfiction or fanart cannot be problematic (if it affirms racism or sexual depictions of minors for example, this is a problem), but that the term is easily misused by individuals who disagree with perhaps the depiction of a character or inspiration for a fictional religion because it does not suit their own interpretation.

One example of fan discourse concerning problematic fan-content that I have encountered is the heterosexualization of a canonically homosexual character named Dorian Pavus in Dragon Age: Inquisition. For brief context, Dragon Age is an RPG game series set in a magical medieval fantasy setting. There is one playable character and they are accompanied by companions as they complete their journey. The playable character can become friends, enemies, and/or lovers with their companions, which sometimes impacts the story heavily. There is an approval system, so a companion's reaction to a choice the player makes can vary greatly depending on whether they have low or high approval. This particular change of sexuality with Dorian is more complicated for fans to come to a consensus with, because the character Dorian has a storyline that, with enough character approval, explores how Dorian’s father did not approve of his sexuality and essentially attempted conversion therapy against Dorian’s wishes. 

“Cultural appropriation and representation”: A few examples of fandom discontent I will dissect come from my own experiences in the Dragon Age fandom on Tumblr.  In Dragon Age, the world is called Thedas (The dragon age world setting), and within this world elves are a group of people who have faced genocide and discrimination for upwards of 940 years. There was much discourse for a time concerning the representation of people of colour in the fandom, who could create marginalized characters, and what choices could be ethically made in-game. 

The character Alistair Therein is beloved by a significant amount of fans, as evidenced by an extensive amount of fanart and fanfiction that is still being created to this day despite the game coming out in 2009. David Gaider is the original writer for the character Alistair, as well as one of the original creators of the first title of the series Dragon Age: Origins. That is all to say, he is one of the writers closest to the material for which the world of the four entries are based on. Alistair is found out to be elf-blooded in a book titled Asunder by David Gaider, which is not entirely known by the entire fandom as it is not information that can be gathered by playing the game (not everyone is an active enough fan to buy or even know about the books) and not every fan is invested in Alistair to begin with. Content creators have been criticized for not drawing or describing Alistair with elf-like ears or darker skin than what is portrayed in-game. The common citation for Alistair having darker skin comes from his canonical mother Fiona, an elf who appears in the book Asunder. There is no actual description of her skin tone, but my theory is that fans perhaps created an image of Fiona as a person of colour before Dragon Age Inquisition released because she is a marginalized character (which is a whole other problematic can of worms in its own right), which created a “fanon” (fan-made canon) that people interpreted as canon despite being false. In any case, creators have been accused of being racist and xenophobic for drawing Alistair as a white man, even though he appears pale in all versions of the texts. I would argue that the demand for content creators to draw and write these characters in a specific way reinforces racism and xenophobia as it is prescribing one identity to a specific tone of skin. To be clear, Alistair’s skin tone is of no concern to the story within the vacuum of Thedas. However, the reasons for which some fans criticize fan art is absurd– Alistair’s mother is from a marginalized group, therefore she must be a POC, and people who do not draw Alistair with obviously elven ears are racist. This line of thinking is reductive and not engaging critically with the text or reality. 

Based on the observations I have made within this discourse, I would argue that this push by fans to have Alistair appear more elven is an example of heterotopia. That is to say, fans who identify more with the marginalized characters (elves) in the text want to see more representation, and so the utopia would be seeing this 'mainstream' character that is widely loved represent the elven population. While I do not think there is anything inherently wrong with this perspective, the way in which fans go about sending hateful messages to other creators for not drawing Alistair the way that they would is deeply inappropriate and not suitable behaviour for a shared fandom space. I would note as well that the strong opinions concerning Alistair do often come from a source of affection. Many creators have followed the game series for more than 10 years, and so these characters are dear to them. When people create their beloved character in a way that they do not agree with, it can be upsetting. An example of how the game developers acknowledge long time fans is with small easter eggs. In Dragon Age Origins, Alistair often asks the playable character “Did you need something.” Although a small piece of dialogue, echoing this for fans who have heard Alistair ask this hundreds of times is very meaningful.

      * *OK, those are pretty fine brownies. The first batch were slightly undercooked and too crumbly to hold together. The second let I cooked at gas mark 5 for about 40 minutes and then put            straight into the fridge. No faffing about with ice baths. Pecans go pretty well as well as walnuts.*
  * postJazz, 12 Sep 2010
    * *Nigel's brownie recipe has been engraved on my brain from the first day I made it, it was so good. I edit it very slightly to my own taste, using 85-100% cacao chocolate, because I like         it to be bitter, and adding cinnamon, nutmeg, a splash of vanilla and a healthy dose of cayenne to them to give them a mexican spice. There is nothing I'd rather eat at 3pm when I'm half         asleep over my desk and need to be woken up. Brilliant.*
  * emzlt, 11 Sep 2010 
    * *I have come across the most divine brownie recipe with a twist - it has cheesecake mix through it. The cheesecake cuts through the richness of the chocolate. It's my new favourite dish.         Either on it's own or warm with a berry coulis... mmmm....*

      * *I worship at the alter of St Nigel. ShallowDays, you haven't lived until you've tried his recipe...*
  * sarahdotcom, 10 Sep 2010
      * *I think brownies need to have three distinct layers: crunchy top (achieved by using a lot of caster sugar), gooey middle, and fudgey bottom. If you put white chocolate chunks in they sink to the bottom and caramelise a little, I love that. This is the best recipe I know: http://yogicknitter.blogspot.com/2008_03_01_archive.html*

      * *The following brownie recipe is based on a French staple ingredient: sweetened chestnut puree. Please trust me on this one and try it. It does not contain much sugar or fat and it's     
      extremely easy to make, gluten free and Utterly Delicious.*
      
      *250 grams of very dark chocolate (70 % plus)
      500 gram tin of sweetened chestnut puree
      6 egg whites
      6 egg yolks
      125 grams very soft butter
      3 tablespoons sugar*
      
      *1. preheat oven to 180 degrees Celsius
      2. melt chocolate au bain Marie in a big glass bowl
      3. allow chocolate to cool a little
      4. add the butter and stir
      5. add the chestnut puree and stir some more
      6. add the egg yolks to this and stir until you’ve got an even mixture
      7. beat the egg whites, in another bowl, until firm
      8. sprinkle the sugar on whites and beat until you've got very firm and glossy peaks
      9. gently fold the whites into the chocolate mixture
      10. pour the mixture into a brownie tin and bake until it looks done but the centre still feels soft to the touch
      11. allow to cool, cut and eat.*
  * stirgently, 10 Sep 2010
    * *The earlier post from Imkm was right on the mark. Brownies should be chewy, not under-cooked. In the UK American brownie recipes are invariably undercooked. When the top looks done, the         bottom is still raw. This occurs because UK ovens heat with 'surround' heat and American ovens have the majority of the heat coming from the bottom of the oven. This is why Alice Medrich         (in the US) puts her brownie pan in an ice bath. This step should be unnecessary in the UK.
      An additional reason for the undercooked, wet texture of brownies in the UK is that American flour absorbs more liquid than UK flour.
      I look forward to trying Felicity's recipe. There is always room for more brownies.*

  * *My grandma must've found this recipe a couple years ago, because that's when she gave it to my family. We love it! However, this recipe doesn't have absolutely PREFECT chocolate frosting        that came with the one my grandma gave us, so I thought I'd help out a bit: ½ C Butter/ 2/3 C Cocoa/ 1 Tsp. Vanilla/ 3 C Powdered Sugar/ 1/3 C Milk - Melt butter, stir in cocoa.           Alternately add sugar and milk, beating to spreading consistency. If necessary, thin with additional milk. Add vanilla. - There we go! I use this frosting recipe every time, and it's perfect for this cake. Hope I helped!!!*

  * *This cake will be printed out as my new basic chocolate cake. Everything about it was nice, I did add a teaspoon of instant coffee to the boiling water and the batter was thin. Baked up    
    perfect - I did line the tin and use oil spray. Tastes better than some expensive box mixes. Wasn't overly moist either, just not dry at all. Thanks. UPDATE: Up the amount of cocoa to 1 cup 
    and make sure it's the best quality. I use a European brand. You can use melted butter if you run out of oil. You can use whipped cream, cocoa powder and icing sugar for a great icing.*

 * *I have joyfully been trying many different cake/frosting recipes from this site and I must say this is about the most moist and delicious I have found! I used this to make cupcakes and what     a perfect batter for the task! It's so "runny" you just pour it into the liners. Halve the recipe and you get 12 cupcakes. Fill the liners 3/4 way full. They come out fluffy and very moist-     PERFECT! I used the "Rich Chocolate Frosting" from this site and it too was superb. (I wrote a review on it as well.)*

  * 06/06/2007
  * *Absolutely delicious and so EASY to make! We made this for a birthday party just last weekend and made another one last night for ourselves. Perfect with some whipped topping, we added a        1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips to make it even more chocolatey! If you do this, make sure to sprinkle it on top of the batter AFTER you have poured it into the baking pan, let them just        sit on the top. Since the batter is thin, mixing them in will cause them to sink to the bottom and stick to the pan as you try to get the cake out.*

  * 05/23/2011
  * *I googled to find a chocolate cake recipe for a baking contest, and picked this one for it's simplicity due to my busy schedule. I won! I won with a perfect score!! The greatest thing           about this cake is how moist it is.... not just fresh-baked, but even a couple of days later. I am adding this recipe to my recipe box! HINT: I use the shorter baking time with all       recipes, subtract 5 minutes, and check the cake by touching with a finger to see if it springs back. What you want is for the cake to spring back but still sound "wet" inside.... Turn off your oven, close the door and let the cake finish its last 5 minutes of bake time. This will allow the cake to set without drying out. Try it!*

  * *This recipe is awesome but remember it will only come out as great as the ingredients you use. I used Hershey's cocoa powder because that's what I had on hand but I would recommend using the highest quality cocoa you can afford! The batter IS really thin, I am SO glad that the recipe included that warning because I woulld have thought I did something wrong. Don't worry!*

  * 04/13/2008
  * *I found this recipe a little under a year ago, and I can't count how many times I've made it. I will never, I repeat, NEVER make another chocolate cake again! I get asked for the recipe constantly, and friends and family beg me to make it. Tip: I make mine with 100% whole wheat flour and you can't tell the difference AT ALL! If you're looking for the best, most moist and flavorful chocolate cake you've ever had, YOU FOUND IT!*

### Marijuana Brownie recipe - https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/how-to-make-weed-brownies?srsltid=AfmBOoqGxP6ckokORqW_DqOXYihFEYU3HjDrb46gbgV67Ep5U-AMWHd- 
Interesting discourse on marijuana consumption in the comments of this edible brownie recipe. Somehow, a user finds it appropriate to attack the Left. 

Ingredients
½g cannabis flower
1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter
⅔ cup coarsely chopped pecans or walnuts
Nonstick vegetable oil spray or room-temperature unsalted butter (for pan)
1 cup (84 g) Dutch-process cocoa powder
1¼ cups (250 g) light brown sugar
2 tsp. vanilla bean paste or vanilla extract
1 tsp. instant espresso powder (optional)
1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt
2 large eggs
⅔ cup (84 g) all-purpose flour
Flaky sea salt (optional)

Special Equipment
An oven thermometer
Preparation
Step 1
Place a rack and an oven thermometer in middle of oven; preheat to 225°. Using your fingers, gently break up ½ g cannabis flower into raisin-size pieces and spread out in an even layer on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake, gently tossing every 10 minutes or so to avoid burning, until weed turns brownish green (indicating it has decarboxylated), 10–20 minutes if using old or lower-quality weed, 15–30 minutes for cured high-quality weed, or 45–60 minutes for anything recently harvested and still damp. Let cool on baking sheet. Increase oven temperature to 350°.

Step 2
Pour water into a medium saucepan to come about 2" up sides. Place a medium heatproof mixing bowl over pot (bowl should not touch water) and set over medium-low heat. Heat ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter and 1 Tbsp. water until butter is melted. Crumble weed with your hands directly into butter. Discard parchment paper; reserve baking sheet. Reduce heat to low and cook, checking occasionally with an instant-read thermometer and adjusting heat as needed to ensure butter temperature does not exceed 190°, 1 hour.

Step 3
Meanwhile, spread out ⅔ cup coarsely chopped pecans or walnuts on reserved baking sheet and toast, tossing halfway through, until slightly darkened in color and fragrant, 8–10 minutes.

Step 4
Lightly coat an 8x8" baking pan with nonstick vegetable oil spray or room-temperature unsalted butter, then line with parchment paper, leaving generous overhang on 2 sides. Lightly coat parchment with nonstick spray or butter.

Step 5
Pour cannabis-infused butter through a fine-mesh sieve into a large heatproof bowl. Immediately stir in 1 cup (84 g) Dutch-process cocoa powder followed by 1¼ cups (250 g) light brown sugar, 2 tsp. vanilla bean paste or vanilla extract, 1 tsp. instant espresso powder (if using), and 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt with a rubber spatula. Add 2 large eggs, one at a time, whisking until incorporated after each addition. Continue to whisk vigorously until mixture is glossy, lightened in color, and slightly increased in volume. Stir in ⅔ cup (84 g) all-purpose flour, then pecans. Scrape batter into prepared baking pan; smooth surface. Sprinkle flaky sea salt over if desired.

Step 6
Bake brownies until set on top and a tester inserted into the center comes out with just a few moist crumbs attached, 25–28 minutes. Remove from oven and tap on stovetop a couple times to deflate slightly (this boosts their chewy-fudgy texture). Let cool 15 minutes, then chill until completely cool, about 45 minutes.

Step 7
Using parchment paper overhang, remove brownies from pan and cut into 16 pieces (about 6¼ mg THC per piece), 12 pieces (about 8⅓ mg THC per piece), or 9 pieces (about 11 mg THC per piece).

Both my sons are allergic to pistachios, cashews, and macadamia nuts. Ingestion causes anaphylactic shock up to and possibly including respiratory failure. A handful of pistachios, in other words, could kill them. Below this recipe is a link to another recipe for a pale-green treat called Pistacharoos, which looks to be chock-full of what is to my sons, poison.

I'm not sure though, because I didn't click on it. Why? Because I know it's not for me or my family. Did I freak out? Did I tell the story about the mislabeled granola bar and the hugely swollen tongue and the ER visit and how NEVER AGAIN will I . . . no I did not. I did not just land on the internet yesterday.

Hi, I have kind of what seems like a dumb question, but I am no baker because of it's required precision. Can I make this recipe and leave out the weed? I am looking for a fudgy brownie recipe to make for my family and the image looks exactly what I am looking for. I assume I just leave out step one and just heat up the butter to temp in step 2?

.5 grams seems incredibly low for an entire batch of brownies? I’ve never seen a recipe use less than 3.5g. .5 grams is equal to 1SMALL joint, which if shared by 12 people would probably equate to 1/2 puff per person - I just don’t understand such a small amount being considered a dose. I’d make myself sick eating brownies trying to get a buzz off of this.

2nd marijuana recipe in two months (different issues)…I’m not interested and am bothered by this. I don’t want to have these recipes intermingled in the issues I save. Why don’t you just make one thin “cookbook” of weed recipes as an insert in a single issue or as a stand-alone keepsake for indulgers? That way, when it is published, those that aren’t interested or opposed, can simply recycle it and be done?  I have been a subscriber for many years, an avid cook and fan of Bob Appetit recipes, but recently the  magazine has a very different vibe that I am losing interest in. Too bad.

I like how this recipe has instructions for dosing. If this your first foray into edibles, go VERY slow - slower than you think you should. Only use a small dose until you are experienced; I would personally go 5mg or less (meaning for the entire time that day you using; not each bite, etc). If you are a little more experienced, and you are not feeling anything after your first dose, wait at LEAST 1 hour (1.5 or 2 is better) before having another dose because sometimes it takes a while to kick-in. Be careful: having too much edibles can be a HORRIBLE experience.

Like all substances, weed is for responsible adults.

The dosage is remarkably low.  1/2 gram for a 8x8 pan of brownies?? That should probably be at least 7 grams. Control the dosage be the size of the brownie otherwise 3 people would have to eat nearly the whole pan of brownies before they would have the munchies for the brownies.

Clearly BA is trying to do something clever for 4/20, but as the other readers point out, the higher strengths of THC have increased the incidences of addiction and psychosis to alarming rates - just ask any psychiatrist or addiction specialist. It happened to our son and two years later, we are just starting to get our feet back under us after one of the most terrifying and tragic seasons of our family’s life. 

I’m grappling with the difference between printing a cannabis recipe and a cocktail recipe and I can’t quite work it out, aside from the fact that too few people seem aware that we are no longer dealing with the same drug we all grew up with. I do appreciate the author’s focus on correct dosing etc.

This makes me so angry!!! Please educate to learn about  today’s high potency THC.  It causes psychosis in 30% of users because of the high THC levels now. Our son, along with a1000 others that we have connected with, experienced CIP- his 3 times each time taking a year or more off of his life with rehab, outpatient rehab, numerous med changes when he never needed any meds before he used weed.  This is not good for society and BA should be thinking what this is doing to our youth and young adults before publishing a recipe that encourages them to use marijuana. 😡😡😡

### French Toast Casserole - Sally's baking addiction - https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/baked-cream-cheese-french-toast-casserole/#tasty-recipes-70955

Ingredients
1 (12-14 ounce) loaf french bread, sourdough bread, or challah*
8 ounces (226g) full-fat brick cream cheese, softened to room temperature*
2 Tablespoons (15g) confectioners’ sugar (do not leave out)
3 teaspoons (15ml) pure vanilla extract, divided
8 large eggs
2 and 1/4 cups (540ml) whole milk
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2/3 cup (133g) packed light brown sugar
Crumb Topping
1/3 cup (69g) packed light brown sugar
1/3 cup (41g) all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled)

1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
6 Tablespoons (85g) unsalted butter, cold and cubed
optional: maple syrup and/or confectioners’ sugar for topping
Cook Mode Prevent your screen from going dark
Instructions

Grease a 9×13-inch baking pan or any 3-4 quart oven-safe dish (pictured) with nonstick spray. Slice then cut the bread into cubes, about 1 inch in size. Spread half of the cubes into the prepared baking pan.
Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the room temperature cream cheese on medium-high speed until completely smooth. Beat in the confectioners’ sugar and 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract until combined. Drop random spoonfuls of cream cheese mixture on top of the bread. Layer the remaining bread cubes on top of cream cheese. (I like to make sure some cream cheese is still exposed on top just for looks.) Set aside.
Whisk the eggs, milk, cinnamon, brown sugar, and remaining vanilla together until no brown sugar lumps remain. Pour evenly over the bread. Cover the pan tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 3-4 hours and up to 24 hours. Overnight is best.
Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Remove pan from the refrigerator.
Prepare the crumb topping: Whisk the brown sugar, flour, and cinnamon together in a medium bowl. Cut in the cold cubed butter with a pastry blender or two forks. Sprinkle the topping evenly over the soaked bread.

Bake uncovered for 45-55 minutes or until golden brown on top. I usually bake it for 45 minutes because I like it softer. Drizzle with optional maple syrup or dust with confectioners’ sugar. Serve warm.
Cover leftovers tightly and store in the refrigerator for 2-3 days.

I have begun to turn to Sally’s whenever I need a new, good recipe for company. For this morning’s brunch, I made this casserole. Got it ready last night, put the topping on this morning and popped it in the oven. It was delicious! My husband loves it! So did my company. Thanks for a great, easy recipe!

I’ve been making French toast casserole for my family’s birthday breakfasts for years. It never occurred to me to add cream cheese, I stumbled across this recipe while on your Pinterest, and I decided to give it a try! We are all glad I did! The cream cheese texture and tanginess makes it a completely different experience. Thank you!!

Brianna says:

Made this for New Year’s Day brunch with my family. Sooooo good! We had a fruit salad and bacon on the side and it was a 10/10 meal. Will definitely make again.

I add a little more powdered sugar to the cream cheese filling. This recipe is perfect otherwise. Thanks so much!

I rarely eat sweets, but made this for Christmas Eve, and it will stay in my memory as the most delicious treat ever! Used sourdough bread (from a bakery) to offset total sweetness, and real maple syrup on top. Served with bacon and coffee…. Who could ask for more! Followed recipe exactly. Make sure to measure bread, so not too dry. Can’t wait for next Christmas! Thank you!!!!

Anna says:

I have made this twice now and it is unbelievably delicious! The cream cheese flavor and texture are both outstanding, and the streusel on top is the perfect touch! Everyone that tried it had rave reviews! I will definitely continue to make this.

Hello there!
I am making this recipe for tomorrow and I went to a local bakery and bought challah bread. I weighed out 14 ounces and cut the bread into cubes, but it only measures out to 8 cups and only makes one layer on the 9 x 13 pan. This bread is very dense and not fluffy so I’m wondering if it’s a problem. I’m afraid if I do another 12 to 14 ounces of bread that it will turn out dry. Any recommendations on what I should do?
 * Michelle @ Sally's Baking Recipes says:

   * Hi Rachel, the 14 oz loaf that you have will be perfect. We wouldn’t add more.

Mary says:

Is there any way to male this without the eggs? I’ve made french toast before just using oatmilk and spices and it was good but I’m wondering how bad this would be withoit the eggs? Would egg replacer work or is there something else I could add to do what the eggs do for this?
 * Beth @ Sally's Baking Recipes says:
   * December 20, 2024
   * Hi LiAnne, we haven’t tested it without the eggs or with an egg replacer, so aren’t sure what to recommend. If you are looking for an egg-free brunch recipe, we have this ham potato   casserole. Obviously very different, but still delicious!

Suz g. says:

Haven’t made this recipe but I do an egg free French toast casserole with chickpea flour (besan) and coconut milk. The trick is to toss the cubed bread all the sauce you make in a bowl, then do the layers as called for in the dish. Otherwise; all the chickpea flour gets layered on top of the bread in the casserole. If done right, it’s delicious! I plan on modifying this recipe to make it egg free next weekend and can report back, if you want.

Hi! Any suggestions for cinnamon alternative (allergy).

Thanks!

  * You could simply leave it out, or even use a small amount of nutmeg for a warm, slightly sweet spice.

Jenn says:
December 18, 2024
I’ve never been more excited to try a recipe! I’ll be short on time, while making other goodies, so could I cut up croissants instead of making croissant bread?
  * Trina @ Sally's Baking Recipes says:
   * December 18, 2024
   * Hi Jenn, we haven’t tested our baked French toast casserole recipes with croissants, so we can’t offer much advice. Let us know if you give it a try!

I have made this twice and it’s absolutely delicious and easy to make. I now have people wanting to pay me to make it for them for their Christmas morning breakfasts. Let’s all keep in mind that I’m not in the catering business but that speaks to the greatness of this recipe.
  * Trina @ Sally's Baking Recipes says:
   * December 17, 2024
   * So glad it’s a hit, Nickie!

Would this recipe cook properly in a crockpot? I would like to make this for an office brunch where oven is not accessible.
Thank you
  * Beth @ Sally's Baking Recipes says:

   * Hi Carolyn, You can use this recipe, but use the slow cooker instructions found in the recipe Notes for our pumpkin French toast casserole.

Brought this recipe (tweaked – sugared cranberries and I toasted my bread in the oven first because I didn’t buy it early enough for it to get stale) to a work brunch today and then I had to go print the recipe for a few people.

I have to say, your recipes (and I’ve used many) are well thought out and work if you weight your ingredients properly. Sally’s is my go to when I’m looking for a specific baked item. I appreciate you. I also appreciate the slam dunks I get at work when I bring in treats!
  * Michelle @ Sally's Baking Recipes says:
   * December 12, 2024
   * So glad this was a hit, Cheryle!

Charli says:
December 11, 2024
This recipe is AMAZING! It’s become a staple for our family and we love it! I’m bringing it for a Christmas Brunch and want to make it festive and plan on using cranberries. Would berries alone be too tart? Or should I use the cranberry jam recipe from Sally’s Brie puff pastries?
  * Trina @ Sally's Baking Recipes says:
   * December 11, 2024
   * Hi Charli! That’s up to your tastes. You could also add sugared cranberries on top – festive and delicious!

Terry says:
December 6, 2024
I have made this, and it is truly delicious. I want to half the recipe to give to my daughter, but I want to use an 9×5 loaf pan. I bought an adorable ceramic one with dog/cat paws. Should it be baked 30 mins then checked for doneness? She will be baking herself since she can’t be with us Xmas morning.
  * Trina @ Sally's Baking Recipes says:
   * December 6, 2024
   * Hi Terry! A loaf pan may not be best for this recipe, since the casserole will be much thicker and the texture will change (less of the topping will get crisp). If you do try it, we are unsure of the bake time needed, but let us know how it goes!

Terry says:
December 27, 2024
I just wanted to let you know I tried the 9×5 loaf pan for my daughter. I cut the recipe in half using about 4-cups of challah bread. She brought it home and Xmas morning left it out for about 20 mins and baked for 50 mins. It worked fine.

Cathy T says:

I buttered the bottom of the pan and under the bread, I added a layer of sliced apples that I had previously prepped with cinnamon and flour and lightly sautéed in butter. Made for a tailgate brunch. It was a hit!

Did you layer the apples on top of in between the bread? Trying this recipe for thanksgiving brunch and I wanted to add apples

   * Hi Judy, you can! See this recipe for baked apple cider French toast for an example.

Ella says:
August 27, 2024
I made this with some cubed homemade cinnamon rolls that came out way to dry. Since the cinnamon rolls already had cinnamon sugar in them I a halved the sugar and cinnamon in the custard mixture. I also added some pecans on top near the end of the bake time. It was great!

Has anyone tried this with sourdough bread?

Ralph W says:
August 2, 2024
I enjoyed this at my friend’s house. It is like eating bread pudding for breakfast. I do not think it needs the maple syrup but that is just me. I have made these kinds of recipes with sourdough bread. It just does not work the way brioche or challah works…or croissant bread, whatever that is. ENJOY IT

Edie says:

I just assembled mine with a strawberry and cream sourdough bread. Will be baking it tomorrow so will update.

Ellie says:
October 6, 2024
I did it with sourdough bread once and I didn’t like it as much as with the other suggested breads. It was just too hard of a bread for me for french toast. Maybe if I had soaked it longer or used fresh sourdough (I used day old leftovers) it would have been better.

Diana says:
July 4, 2024
I’ve made this a few times as-is and it’s amazing.

I’m wondering your thoughts on using leftover cornbread instead of French bread?

   * Hi Diana, we haven’t tried! Let us know how it turns out if you do.

### Statistic on Game Developpers

Something very interesting I read noted that 31% of game developpers are women and (or) non-binary. The video game community is well-known to be a male-dominated space, yet the statistic suggests that a significant portion of this space is filled with both women and those that identify under the LGBTQ+ umbrella. 
One of the reasons I can see these individuals inclined to video games is that it is a safe storytelling outlet. That is, within the vacuum of a video game, it is often possible to create a character that can overcome insurmountable obstacles and succeed in their endeavors and receive widespread praise and support regardless of their identity, gender, or sexuality. Very obviously, this is not the case in reality. 

### AI-Generated Nonsense

Something I have noticed in the dystopia nightmare that the world is of late, is the heavy presence of AI, whether that be generated images, bots, news articles, etc. I do not want to want to come across as overly supportive of AI because I think it has so many more negative qualities about it as rather than positive. However, a few examples that I have enjoyed are counter-propoganda pieces of AI generated towards current American poltics, such as the memeification of actions taken by Donald Trump, Elon Musk, JD Vance, and Karoline Leavitt. In the face of blatant nationalistic propoganda and lies that are communicated by these individuals, AI generated memes and images that mock these individuals is a small form of protest that is historically typical of counter culture that arises with authoritarian governments (like Black Panther movement in the 60's and Punk movements in the 70's for example). The more negative and dominant side is, of course, the echo chamber of Right propoganda that is created by bots concerning political topics that influence real people. In the same vein, the fake news articles with no real author, fake references, and false information that gets spread around by real people to justify their opinions of real life. 

### Gretchen Adler - I want my kids to know what cheeseits taste like - elitest baking 
https://www.tiktok.com/@thehealthywife/video/7353786984067763498
In this tiktok, Adler again makes crackers from scratch so that her kids could eat a similar kind of snack without 'poisoning' her children with unhealthy food. Before I dissesct the video, I want to list a lowball rough estimate of how much the items she uses in her kitchen cost:
-Large food processor and grater: $150
-Rolling pin: $3
-Shape cutter: $3
-Baking paper: $3
-CHEEZIT RECIPE:
  16oz raw cheddar cheese, shredded
  1 cup sourdough discard
  1 stick or 1/2 cup butter
  1.5 tsp unrefined salt
  3 cups whole wheat einkorn flour (approximately 1.5 cups berries, milled)

  1. Put cheese and discard in food processor and blend
  2. Add chopped cold butter, salt and flour, then blend and pulse.
  3. Turn dough into bowl and massage to make sure everything is mixed well.
  4. Cover with cling wrap and refrigerate overnight or up to 2 days to allow to ferment.
  5. Remove from fridge and allow to come to room temp, may take more than 1 hour.
  6. Roll out on parchment paper and thin as you can with rolling pin. Transfer to baking sheet. Take a pastry or pizza cutter to make 1” parallel         and perpendicular cuts.
  7. Sprinkle with sea salt and bake at 375F of approx 18 minutes until gold brown.
  8. Allow to cool as crackers will harden and crisp up.

The cost would be around $20 for the ingredients, and that is assuming one already has the resources to keep up a sourdough culture. 
  -Contents and date sticker, meaning she has a printer of some sort, which costs hundreds of dollars
  -Overall, if a person did not have these resources and wanted to buy them to makes these crackers for their kids, it would cost them around $189, 2 days and 1 hour of prep time, and 18 minutes of cook time. Moreover, Adler produces her own cheese with animals on her property, so she uses raw cheese rather than store-bought, which she would not feed to her children. 
Besides the elitest attitude of how Adler insists people must feed their children (otherwise parents are poisoining them, as she puts it), a common occurence in recipes is the assumption that everyone has professional kitchen appliances such as stand mixes, food processors, blenders, etc. This might lead to baking being a more common hobby for a certain classification of people based on incame. 

### Meme counter propoganda
(https://www.threads.net/@elhowieson_/post/DH0BONhSvmV?xmt=AQGzQ3vcD2Lbw79nflCzw9xleviXgo5OXnP2rDavqOZXbw)This video is one example of what I want to touch on in terms of counter propaganda against Trump’s administration. Looking at the very basic meaning of the meme (as the individuals within the video on the Graham Norton show are not relevant to the message of the meme), it is essentially praising Mark Carney for his positive positive political relationship to other world leaders in the face of Trump’s politically isolating tariffs and economic propaganda. Part of Trump’s positionally is attempting to portray the USA as a martyr figure— that other countries such as Canada have been taking advantage for many years. While this is demonstrably false, people aligned within the MAGA following are enthusiastic about his new policies. In any case, what is interesting to me and how this exemplifies as a DH artefact is that this meme is very clearly an example of political activism. What I do not have an answer to is what exactly does this achieve (beyond a sigh/chuckle when a person who agrees watches the video). Because a person’s social media is severely biased according to their interests and curated algorithm, are political memes stuck in a vacuum within the confines of their own political sphere, and if so, do they have any impact on opposing ideologies? I hope they do. 

### The Hunger Games Memes resurgence 
To be clear, I think this tiktok is cringy, but it still proves my point
https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMBXvThvS/
Since the new Hunger Games book has been announced titled Sunrise on the Reaping, there has been an uptick in the interest of the Hunger Games series once again. People have been making fan posts varying from predictions about the story, to direct comparisons with how the dystopic state of the US as it appears in The Hunger Games is concerningly close to the present day US. While the first 3 entries of the series is more focused on the structure of capitalism (the enemy 'state' quite literally being called the Capitol), this text is more focused on propoganda, the mass spread of misinformation, and the problem with eternal compliance. 
This video specifically is not good, but it is more accessible than instagram. In fact, the Hunger Games merchanidise that the people in the tiktok are wearing is very much out of touch with the anti-capitalist/ultra-consumer and materialism criticisms from the main trilogy. In any case, the fact that people are looking to the Hunger Games series, a series that is concerned with rebellian and revolution in a fascist/authoritarian dictatorship should be raising more eyebrows than it is. Again, Suzanne Collins' timing is immaculate and I would argue is present days George Orwell in terms of how important her text is to the political climate of North America and relevance to our future. 

### I have abandoned baking for the end of the world
Like a lot of things in my life, researching baking is not at the top of my list right now when there is a literal coup happening in the US.

Donald Knuth, Literate programming (1984), p. 9

Python

Benefits

Generally more readable
Easier to see problems in the code
Processes data quickly
Constraints

Automates certain functions which can limit what it can do
Programmer friendly vs machine friendly
Observations

Have to imput in code functions (while analyzing text) for the program that our brains would automatically do. Ex: I ignored words like 'the' and 'and' , but I would have to explicitly write this in the command line.
stopwords - words to be excluded
io means input/output. input a file to generate an output
Humans can separate strands of text, computer needs command line specification
for loop - run the function until the requirements are met
Note that computers 'think' in binary terms. Yes or no, never maybe and always objective
Flow chart activity - yes or no, process of buying chocolate ice cream, the conditions that can be answered with yes or no to meet the requirements to buy ice cream
